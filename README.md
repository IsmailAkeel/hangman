Project Overview
The Hangman game is designed to be a console-based game where players try to guess a randomly chosen word. Players are given a set number of guesses, and incorrect guesses reduce the number of guesses left. Additionally, a help system is available that reveals letters but penalizes the player by removing additional guesses.

How to Play
The game starts by randomly selecting a word from a list of words.
The player has 10 guesses to figure out the word.
For each guess:
If the guessed letter is in the word, it is revealed in the wordâ€™s progress.
If the guessed letter is not in the word:
If it is a consonant, the player loses 1 guess.
If it is a vowel, the player loses 2 guesses.
Players can use the help feature by typing !, which reveals a letter but costs 3 guesses.
The player wins if they guess the word before running out of guesses.
Files
hangman.py: The main script that runs the Hangman game.
words.txt: A file that contains a list of words from which the game chooses the secret word.
Installation
